	# A Little About Me 🥸
    
    My name is Micah Raybuck, and I am a web developer. I started working with my friend Drew Karriker, who has taught me everything I know. He brought me onboard his team, and now we are working together on developing a curriculum for his course “Coding With Drew”. I’ve learned so much in such a short period of time, and I can’t wait to see where this path takes me. 

	I’ve always loved technology, and I would consider myself a pretty tech-savvy guy. I was born in 2002, right about when the digital age started to explode with new commercial technologies. Smart phones, personal computers, AI, and more. I have been around tech my entire life, and I love it! I want to be a part of building something great to help people learn and advance in life.
